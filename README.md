# Turbulence
The purpose of the "Turbulence Repository" is to consolidate all the code developed for the turbulence studies conducted during my doctoral thesis, ensuring that it is reproducible and accessible to the scientific community.

GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------

Title and description of the dataset:

ADCP Turbulence Analysis Toolkit

The presented codes are designed to facilitate the study of velocities measured with an ADCP through classical Fourier analysis or Wavelet analysis. Additionally, they enable the visualization of velocity time series in histogram or box-plot formats.
